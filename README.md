Assignment 5 TriviaGame 

Overview: created a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. I chose the theme of World History so users can answer some of the questios. To develop this website I used, Javascript, bootstarp, CSS, HTML for logic, styling, layout and and content manipulations.

How the user will play the game:

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
* If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
